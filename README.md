Description:
This project focuses on testing the efficiency of various optimized binary search algorithms and band join operations. These algorithms include techniques like arithmetic optimization, SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data), bit masking, and loop unrolling. The project demonstrates how these optimizations can significantly enhance performance, which is critical for database operations.


Instructions:
- make the executable with the command <make>
- run the executable with the command <./name> N X Y Z R
- N: Number of elements in the array being searched
- X: outer table band join (ignore for the project and supply a dummy value )
- Y: size of the output result (ignore for the project and supply a dummy value )
- Z: bound (ignore for the project and supply a dummy value )
- R: Number of repeates for the experiment, Help toward computing the the average run time over the multiple results
